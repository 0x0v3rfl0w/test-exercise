# Gilded Rose starting position in Ruby

## Installation


## Run the unit tests from the Command-Line

Ensure you have RSpec installed

gem install rspec

## For run  gilded_rose_spec.rb

rspec gilded_rose_spec.rb

## For run  gilded_rose_tests.rb

In newer versions of Ruby, test specifications are often written using Minitest and include the Minitest::Test syntax. Earlier versions of Ruby could also use another testing framework, such as Test::Unit.

Thus, my test code complies with modern practices of writing tests in Ruby, what was written before did not work for me

Use Ruby 3.1.4 pls

Use command ruby gilded_rose_tests.rb

## For run  texttest_fixture.rb

All work is fine.
Just use ruby texttest_fixture.rb

I use ruby-3.1.4

## For run programm

Use ruby main.rb
